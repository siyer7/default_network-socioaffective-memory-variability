2,"30 year old, with a new child. Carrier of CF. Went to children's hospital to get tested for CF. They used electric shock on his hands for 10 minutes straight and he waited in the lobby with gauze on his wrists to produce sweat for 30 min. 

Normally healthy looking, so most people don't know he struggles with CF. Decides to lead healthy life to manage CF.
Infant child diagnosed with mutated gene that cause CF symptoms ranging in severity. Many hours to drive to hospital for testing and treatment. Financial burden to get proper treatment that is not covered by insurance.
Went through a lot of checkups to make sure she was a good candidate for a lung transplant. 
He wrote a poem about struggling with CF, feeling like a failure because he can't work to provide for himself, watching his brother die of CF, having seen so many of his family and friends pass away due to CF. The depression that living with CF causes, how difficult it is to carry on a normal relationship with someone. The hours spent at a hospital and not taking life for granted.

I don't really remember well, I think she was talking about her child at one point.

4,"Jacob took a sweat test to determine whether or not he has CF. He does not have the fully developed disease, but he is at risk for it. He feels that having CF is difficult because people with CF can't interact much due to the immune system risks.
Laura's daughter Riley was diagnosed with CF as a newborn, although a more experienced hospital later determined that she is merely at risk for the disease rather than already having it fully. There are a variety of triggers which could lead to Riley developing the disease either in a mild or severe form, and Laura worries a great deal about accidentally exposing Riley to one of those triggers.
Molly is from England and she is applying for a lung transplant. She was motivated to apply after her friend Emma passed away from CF. Molly initially thought she wouldn't be able to get a transplant due to a bacteria present in her body, but as she has been clean of the bacteria for 18 months she may be eligible. She took a set of tests in July and is retaking the same tests, as well as meeting with a variety of doctors and surgeons, to determine whether or not she will be approved for the transplant.
Morgan's lungs acted up in response to the smell of something in a store, and a woman gave him an ugly look. During the video, Morgan talked about how he could have told her all the terrible things about having CF (such as the friends he has lost and the daily struggles he experiences), or the silver linings (such as appreciating the little things in life), but instead he just smiled at her and went on his way.

5,"Jacob learned later in life that he has CF. The nurse told him not to look CF up on the internet, but he did anyway. He feels isolated because there are no CF support communities. He is worried that his son might have CF, but that would only occur if his wife Sarah also carries the gene. He eats healthy.
Laura's child has CF, but it might not show unless triggered. She has to go on 5 hour dirves every 2-3 months. The disease is very taxing financially. Her child pooped a weird poop which made her break down because it was a sign that her child did indeed have CF.
Molly is British. She is applying for a transplant of an organ I can't remember.  She had to do a lot of testing in July to be put on the transplant list.
Morgan is poetic. I couldn't tell if he was the one with CF or his brother or both. He explained that when people are dying they need love.

7,"Jacob was told not to look up CF but did it anyway and was scared after seeing the results. He had to do the sweat test and said it was super painful (10 minutes on each arm). He wish more people understood what the sickness was so that they people wouldn't ignore the fact that he is sick. 
Her baby has one gene for cystic fibrosis and she had to drive 5 hours to a hospital where thy told her the mutation may never show symptoms or it might if its triggered. She has to watch every little thing her kid does in case something gets triggered. 
Molly is trying to get a lung transplant after her friend died from CF and is reaching out to show people the effects and seriousness of the disease. Last time her organs got checked they looked good and she was going  to get them checked again very soon.
He coughed and the lady looked at him funny and he said no its okay I have CF its not contagious. He wanted tot ell her everything CF was like how many people he lost from it an dhow appreciative of life he is from it but all he did was smile and walk away. He had did a full poem.

8,"I remember him going to the pediatrics doctor and having to be electrocuted for 10 minutes on each arm and then wear gauze in order to produce sweat. he said that he was very scared because he googled exactly what F meant and realized that he put himself into a lot of panic. He has a child and every now and then he gets scared that the baby might have it.
Her daughter has it. They have to travel about 5 hours away in order for her to see a doctor that is specialized in this disease. The parents are really cautious with her and the mom told us a lot about how the baby  experiences symptoms but she still doesn't have full on CF. 
I don't remember much from this video. Her accent and high-pitched voice mad it hard to decipher what she was saying. 
he talked a lot about the people he lost to this disease. When he went to the mall, he smelled a perfume that caused him to go into a coughing fit and some lady looked at him as if he was about to infect everyone. He wrote a beautiful poem talking about the different struggles of CF which actually made me a little emotional.

10,"Jacob went to go get tested for Cf. The process was not pleasant, and he went to a children's hospital. He worries for his child when he coughs, and talked about how his condition is not visible to others and cannot have a support group for Cf.
Laura's baby Riley has CF, but it is the kind where she doesn't have to experience so many effects. They have to drive 5 hours to get her to the right doctors.
Molly is looking to fight her disease to stay alive and has had multiple procedures and tests done on her.
Morgan spoke about his daily experiences with CF starting with how he was smelling something but began coughing and told a lady that it was not contagious, but what he didn't tell her is about losing so many friends, brothers, having depression, wearing ashes around his neck, knowing he's going to die, and how he wishes he could work, complain about Monday mornings, and that he likes hearing the birds in the morning because they're alive, and he's alive.

11,"This 30 year old man was carrying cystic fibrosis but he didn't have any symptoms of the disease. He was worried about his small child having the disease but he knew that it wasn't possible since his wife didn't have the mutation of cystic fibrosis.
Laura had a baby daughter who is carrying cystic fibrosis. When her daughter showed a symptom of cystic fibrosis, she called the place that is five hours away, but they recommended that she go to see the local doctor. She is very concerned about her daughter and is aware of all the money and time that goes in to being a parent to a child with CF.
Molly had to take a ton of tests to decide if she was available to do a transplant. After doing a number of tests, she had to be 18 months free of some sort of test until she could be eligible for the test. She had to spend a ton of time just to do the tests to see if she was eligible for the transplant.
Morgan had a lung issue in the mall because he smelled a strong perfume. A woman looked at him and seemed disgusted and he was offended because the woman knew nothing about his struggles with CF. He went on to describe his personal struggles with CF, about how his mom cried because she thought her son might die, his dad thought he was a failure because he couldn't hold a job, and how he has lost countless friends to the disease.

12,"Jacob started off by describing the story of when he first found out he potentially had CF. The doctor told him not to google CF, only to look at the CF Foundation webpage. He immediately googled CF before leaving the parking lot. He went to go do a skin test where they hooked up an electrode to each arm for ten minutes each, testing ion flow, but as he said, ""they electrocuted me for 10 whole minutes."" Then he went back out to the waiting room, a 30 year old man among a room full of children, waiting for 30 minutes. They had bandaged up his wrists and he began to sweat in them. When the 30 minutes was over, they took a sample off the bandage to be sent for testing of ion concentrations. 

Jacob described how CF is a lonely disease. When he first found out he had CF, he wanted to find a support group or other people who had CF. However with the nature of the disease and the immune system, it is hard to find CF groups or people who gather together. Very few of his family members and relatives understand CF. Also because he looks healthy, it is hard to advocate in the name of the disease because people think he is not sick.

He often looks at his baby son and gets scared every time he coughs. Even though he knows they are baby coughs, he fears if his son had CF. It is not possible because his wife is not a carrier for CF but still the thought crosses his mind. Jacob's philosophy in life is to stay healthy and strong to fight off any possible infections that might come his way. 
Laura told the story of having her child tested for CF. She took her baby to be tested and when she heard the news, she and her husband was devastated because they had had hopes and dreams for their children. As a parent, it is something extremely difficult to go through because you want to help your child to the best of your ability but sometimes it is hard to help. You are constantly making doctors and hospital visits. She talked about how she had to drive 5 hours to take her child to the hospital, and she empathized with other parents- what if they don't have the money to drive long trips to the hospital? What if they don't have the time or the same resources as she does to help with the health of the child? 
Molly told her story of her decision to get a lung implant (with her British? accent). At first she was not going to get an implant and the doctor advised her against it. She was going to fight CF on her own. Eventually she saw friends of hers fighting against CF and she agreed she was going to fight to and not just sit around for her body to waste itself. She consulted her mom and ultimately decided that a transplant was what she wanted. Before the transplant, she had to undergo very many tests, needles, blood drawn and other checks to make sure that her body could accept the transplant. She is about to undergo the transplant but before the operation, they have to repeat the tests. She has already talked with the doctors, nurses, social worker, and others in preparation for the transplant. 

Her life philosophy is that she wants to do everything she can to fight CF and have an impact while she is alive, rather than await the time that her body degrades.
Morgan spoke with charisma and honesty. He was walking in a mall when some smell in the air caused him to have a coughing attack. Any small thing in the air can trigger his lungs to have a reaction. A woman in the mall looks at him with those eyes as though he was cough the black plague onto everyone in the mall.

His spoken word poetry pours into what he would say to the lady to explain CF. He would tell her that CF is when your father looks at you as a disappointment because he could never be the hardworking son that his father wanted him to be. CF is having an average life span of 41 but seeing his friends fall to CF in the early 20s. CF is isolation, loneliness, given up hopes, hurt, inability and many other things.

However, Morgan switches his tone in the middle to explain the positive aspects of CF. He describes how CF is not taking any moment for granted because you are more aware that moments are few and that life is short. CF is seeing the beauty in the world and the flowers and birds. CF not taking for granted the preciousness of life and the joy in each day.

13,"Jacob Googled CF in the hospital parking lot even though the nurse told him not to. During his CF test he got hooked up to a battery and was ""electrocuted"" on each arm for 10 minutes. He also had to sit in a room of children sweating into gauze on his arm. Jacob is a carrier and so is his son, so he's really worried whenever his son coughs that he has full on CF. CF is a lonely disease because you can't meet up regularly because risk of infection; also it's an invisible disease so people don't acknowledge your sickness. 
Laura's daughter, Riley, was diagnosed with CF at 1 week. Initially they were told that she would live to be around 30-40 years old. They live in a small town so they have to drive 5 hours to a bigger hospital to get treatments; there they also learned that it was unclear whether Riley would develop symptoms of CF or not. It's really exhausting and expensive to treat CF, as some treatments are not covered by insurance. Laura seemed really composed and matter-of-fact. Laura found fatty stool in Riley's diaper and called the hospital. 
(I couldn't hear the audio super well). Molly was saying something about a lung transplant. She described the tests required to get on the list, including breathing tests and heart scans. She said something sad about her mom. She also said something about not wanting to be passive, but instead anything she could. 
Morgan smelled some perfume and it made him cough a lot, which scared a nearby lady. He thought of how to describe that it was because of CF, and what CF was. He described a lot of heartbreaking experiences, like being a disappointment to his father for not being ""strong"" like he expected, and of hearing his mom cry while he played, of remembering his dead brother while he drank Jack Daniels. He described wondering how long he would live, while his elementary school classmates wondered what they would be when they grew up. He wears someone's ashes in a necklace. Nurses jokingly made him a ""welcome home"" sign when he was readmitted into the hospital. Friends would stay with him in the hospital until midnight on his birthday. People don't want to date him because they don't want to see him die, which he understands so he has given up. He has seen more friends die than people usually do in four lifetimes. He decides not to explain to the lady next to the perfume.

15,"I remember Jacob being sweat tested for CF when he was 30 and how uncomfortable he felt amongst the other children in the waiting room.  How he was told by his nurse not to google CF; but he did before leaving the parking lot.  He worries it will pop up on him one day and always keeps it in the back of his mind.  He has a son; and can't help but fear every little cough.
He is not currently exhibiting any of the complications/symptoms of CF.  His wife's name is Sarah.  He wanted to join a support group for CF; but there are non out there because of the ease at which people with CF can get sick.  He seemed disappointed that the people in his life didn't see him as ""sick""; because the disease had not manifested itself in a way his friends and family could see. 
Laura was told her daughter had an abnormal newborn screen; she was assumed to have CF.  They drove 5 hours multiple times to a hospital M-something.  They live in Georgia. She fears for her daughters CF to be triggered and doesn't feel like she can leave her at daycare or even a family members home.  The treatments are expensive.  She found an abnormal stool in her daughters diaper and freaked out inside; though never told her husband.  The hospital said to just wait and see if any other symptoms show themselves.
Molly was hard for me to understand.  She lost someone who was on the transplant list and it caused her to rethink her previous ideas about being on the transplant list herself.  She had to undergo a lot of testing to be approved for the test and had a few hiccups along the way (Bacteria that was growing not compatible with transplants) But after 18 months they believe she is a good candidate for a lung transplant and is hopping her Christmas gift this year is to see her name go onto the transplant list.  She is determined not to go out without a fight.
Morgan started his story with a trip to the department store; his lungs caught a whiff of the perfume counter and started a tickling frenzy.  A woman gave him a look like he just coughed up the plague.  He responded; its not contagious; i just have CF.  Then went into all the things that ran through his head ""should I tell her?""  About all the friends ""brothers"" he's lost to CF already at age 20.  About what life is like with CF and not being able to life up to his fathers potential of being a hard working man because of his illness.  Of being in the hospital so frequently; the staff now feel like family. About how you appreciate the chirping of the birds in the morning and the sunrise; only to feel overcome by sadness remembering all those people you cared about who will never experience it again.  He shared thoughts of what it was like to stand/sit next to your friend and watch them die; all the while telling them to fight and that everything will be ok.

16,"Jacob was diagnosed later in life, and at 30, sat in a room after having gotten the sweat test - he had the ""mad scientest"" nurse who flipped the switch to ""electrocute him"" and once tehy werpaped him in guaze, he sat with a bunch of kids, which was awkward for him. He explained the difficulty of being diagnosed but not appearing sick, even for those who know that he's sick, them not acknowledging it. HE also explained his fear for his kid, every time the kiddo coughs. 
Laura shared that a week after her child's birth, the pediatrician's office called to say that something had come back from the newborn screen - she got worried, and wanted to know on the phone, but they said she had to go bakc. SHe shared that they went to the pediatrician's office and found out that her child had CF, though they didn't understand what it meant. They went to a specailist 5 hours away and found out that it wasn't direct CF, but something with a mutation toward it, and that with triggers, her child could develop CF. She explained the fears and concerns that go with it, including wehther to send hcild to daycare, or have her go to family member's houses out of fear. She also sahred that her child has shown a couple of symptoms - she appeared worried.
Molly's video was the hardest to watch and attend to because the audio didn't match the video and her eyebrows looked computer drawn on as opposed to real. 

She shared that she's waiting on a lung transplant after a friend died from CF. she shared taht she had to undergo a lot of testing, that she was initially denied a transplant because of bacteria, but that she's 18 months clear of it and undergoing testing again. She is doing it in memory of her deceased friend.
Morgan shared that in a department store, he walked by a fragrance counter which had a scent, which triggered a coughing spell. He said that a woman looked at him as if he'd spread the plague, and that he considered how to respond. In the poem he was reading, he expressed how he's witnessed so many people die, called other CF people his brothers and sisters, said that he lost a brother. He shared about the heartache of not knowing whether he'd live or die another day, and of loss. He talked about being in the hospital, and the comraderie of others who are going through the same disease. He also shared about the joy of waking up knowing he was alive, and of being able to appreciate it. In the end, he chose to smile at the woman in the department store and walk away.

19,"I remember that this patient was told when he was 30 that he had the CF disease. He recalled being to not google cystal fibrosous and to only look at the foundation website for information. He then immediately went to the wiki page and realised that it was a mistake. He felt scared at the information. He then went on to talk about the sweat test that he had to go through. This was where he had what looked like a car battery attached to his arm with jumper cables, and he had an electric current go through both his arms for 10 minutes each. He then had both arms wrapped in gauze and had to wait in the waiting room with several kids, where he felt uncomfortable. He ended with how hard it was for people with CF because people don't sympathize because he doesn't ""look"" sick.
This woman was told that her newborn baby of a week old had abnormal results from a certain test and that she should come in immediately. She was told that her daughter carried the gene for CF disease and that she was a carrier. This was at the local hospital, and several weeks later, her husband and her went to the bigger hospital at Augusta, where they found out more information. With better testing, they were told that her daughter showed signs of carrying the disease, and that symptoms would only show up if triggered, or maybe not at all. She goes on to talk about how stressful and hard their lives were following this, how they were scared any little thing might trigger her disease, and how financially straining their lives had become.
This girl's friend who also suffered from CF disease had just previously died while waiting for a transplant. She talks about how she hadn't previously been that proactive bout getting transplants and working towards curing herself, but that this recent event motivated her to do so. She talked about how she began taking tests and how she had to wait for a year and a half to be eligible for a transplant. She talked about the numerous types of tests she had to go through up until the point of her transplant.
This was the first video. He told a story about when he was in a grocery line, and something triggered his CF disease. A lady nearby him looked worried, and he began to think about all the things he would like to explain to her about the disease he suffered from. He then goes on a very emotional and poetic rant on all the things he wished he could tell this woman. He talks about all of the many struggles he has faced, the loved ones he's seen die in front of him, and the abnormal amount of pain he has gone through for a person of his age. This was very emotional as he began to cry thinking about all of his loved ones that he has seen suffer. He then says that he didnt say any of this stuff to the woman and that he just smiled and walked away.

22,"Jacob spoke about his own personal experience with CF, and he began by saying something about how someone (?) told him you should NOT google CF, and then he did it anyway and he was freaked out. He spoke in a more personal way than the others (in my opinion), and showed a couple of images that I felt made the story more engaging (although I can't honestly remember what they were - the first one was his arm with an IV I think?). I liked his story the most because he spoke about it sort of as a storyline, and he seemed the most like me in personality. I know he talked about how it was tough because people don't really think of you as sick, when in fact you are.
Honestly do not remember anything, except I liked her and related to her. Since this was the first video I was distracted by other things like her surroundings. She talked about a family member who had CF, right? And at the beginning she said something about how they were diagnosed as a newborn I think?
Ugh, I don't remember anything this girl said except that I found her voice really annoying and she continued to repeat ""cystic fibrosis"" in every single sentence. I stopped listening to her pretty early on because she was boring me. =/
This guy bothered me right off the bat because I couldn't tell if what he was doing was poetry or just reading prose off a piece of paper - either way, both things that I don't like - and I think that if you are trying to do something artistic, then the eye contact is so important, and he missed the mark there. He recited a poem about what it was like to have CF, and I remember it got more emotional, in a sort of angry way, at the end. It was something about how somebody asked him what having CF was like, I think? And then he had some repetition that I can't remember, like ""Having cystic fibrosis..."" blabla, and each line started with that. He also coughed a few times throughout, which I actually found more powerful than anything he said, because that brought his CF diagnosis to the forefront.

Lauras daughter was diagnosed with CF shortly after birth. She has the form that is (recessive?) she may or may not develop symptoms. Laura was initially told that her daughter would only live to 35-40 but that diagnosis seemed to change with the further understanding that she is not a full blown CF patient. They travel 5 hours to get their daughter to a hospital that can deal with her CF. The baby had fatty stool which was a first symptom. They were traveling 5 hours every 1-2 months for testing.
Molly is awaiting news from testing that she had done to see if she is a candidate for a transplant. Initially she wasn't due to an infection that she had. But once she was clear she went through the testing and is in the waiting process.
Morgan talks about having a coughing fit in a department store when he smelled a perfume called Delicious.

26,"i remember him saying that nobody thinks of him as 'sick' really as he didn't show many symptoms. 
she had to travel 5 hrs to a hospital and do this very often with a toddler.
i remember her talking about all the appointment - and how expensive everything was - medicine, tests - and how insurance doesn't always cover everything.  and it is all very draining.  emotionally and financially.
i could't hear almost any of what she said.   her voice was very quiet, my volume was on t he loudest.  and she had an accent so i unfortunately missed most of what she said.  she looked very sad and i caught that she was talking about different tests she needed done and how awful it was for her.  
he was in the store, and wanted to tell the woman who worked there all about CF, and how the smallest thing can make somebody w/ CF sick,  and how it's so hard to have a relationship w/ somebody w/ CF - as they die at a young age.  and it's reallly hard to be involved w/ somebody who has it.  he seemed angry.  in the end he just smiled at the woman.  and didn't tell her all of this.

27,"He talked about going to a children's hospital to get testing done. They strapped his arm to a car battery looking thing and electrocuted him for 10 minutes, then the doctor switched the setup to his other arm. Next he said he sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes was gauze wrapped around his wrist. After 30 minutes they took a sample of gauze for testing for sodium chloride levels.
Laura talked about her newborn childhood who likely had CF. She described how she had to drive 5 hours to see a doctor because there aren't many CF doctors in Georgia. She talked about how she had to drive her infant daughter 5 hours to a hospital multiple times a year for tests and observations.
Molly talked about the process of getting a lung transplant. One of her friends had recently passed away due to CF complications, and Molly decided she needed to do something about her own CF condition. She described how getting on the transplant list involved lots of tests and experiments to make sure her body was ready for such a procedure. She ended by saying she passed and is now on the transplant list.
Morgan's video was a spoken-word style piece. He described how a perfume at a department store caused a coughing attack that worried another customer at the store. He went into a long monologue about what it's like to live with CF and all the unforeseen things associated with the disease. His main message was that we should all be happy to be alive everyday.

HE WAS THEN GIVEN GAUZE TO SWEAT INTO IN A ROOM WITH A FEW CHILDREN. HE IS TERRIFIED THAT HIS SON WILL GET IT AND CURES HIMSELF BY MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. 
SHE MADE MANY FIVE HOUR CAR JOURNEYS WITH HER KID, FELT DRAINED FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY, CAR JOURNEYS ARE VERY LONG FOR SMALL CHILDREN, SHE REALLY EMPATHIZED WITH OTHER PARENTS WHO HAD TO CHECK ON THEIR KIDS CONSTANTLY AND GET MANY TESTS. 
HER FRIEND WHO ALSO SUFFERED FROM THE DISEASE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY AT THE AGE OF 20, WHICH MADE HER SIGN UP AND DO TESTS TO GET A LUNG TRANSPLANT, WHICH SHE FINDS OUT AOUT ON THURSDAY AND WOULD BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER. 
HE STARTED HAVING A SEIZURE FROM A PERFUME AND THE PERSON LOOKED AT HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD BLACK LUNG. HE FEELS SUICIDAL AND DEPRESSED AND HAS EXPERIENCED MORE LOSSES THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD IN FOUR LIFE TIMES, BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THAT HE REALLY APPRECIATES THE NOISY BIRDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKES THE MOST OF EVERYTHING. IN THE END HE JUST SMILED AND WALKED AWAY FROM THE SALESPERSON. HE MISSES HIS BROTHER.

32,"Jacob is a carrier for CF. He was tested when he was 30 years old. He had the sweat test done. He is concerned for his daughter because he is a carrier, but he knows that she will not have it because his wife Sarah is not a carrier. He and his wife would both have to be carriers for his daughter to have CF. However, that does not keep him from worrying about her every time she coughs.
Lauras daughters newborn screening came back abnormal. A week after she was born her husband was sitting down with the doctor and told them that their daughter would not live back 35 because she had CF. Now doctors in her area were not all that educated on CF so they drove 5 hours to Augusta, GA to have their daughter checked. They found out that there was not a lot known about her daughters specific genetic mutation. What they did know was that there was a possibility that her daughter may have no symptoms, some symptoms, or sever symptoms. So every 2-3 months for the first year and a half of her daughters life they traveled to Augusta to have her checked. She now has some symptoms of CF and they are monitoring it.
Molly is currently working on being put on a transplant list. For the longest time she did not want a transplant, but watching her friend Emma pass away at 20 made her rethink her decision. So she started the process, at first she wasn't cleared by doctors because of an infection that she had, but she has been 18 months clean from that infection and is now almost finished with the process to be put on the transplant list. 
Morgan has CF and has lost many people in his life to CF including his brother. He did spoken word about CF and how he feels living with CF. If he could tell the whole world had hard life with CF is he would but he feels they still wouldn't understand.

34,"This speaker talked about the news of being told he had a rare form of CF, that the health professionals had advised him to not google the disease ( the he did anyway). He talked about wanting to connect with other people who had CF, but because of immunity issues it was a problem. He talked about how others did not perceive him as sick, though he was, and he was frustrated by this. He also talked about going to a clinic in Dallas for information.
The speaker above talked about getting the news about her child that they had CF, and that it was a rare form that may not present with symptoms, but could be triggered by any event. She worried about doing normal things such as bringing her chid to daycare in fear that it could be a trigger. She recalled about how hard it was to drive 5 hours in a car with a child and that the clinic was far if something happened. 
The speaker above covered her journey in CF and her hopes for a lung transplant. She talked about the large number of tests to go through to even be considered a transplant candidate. She also mentioned that it would be the best christmas present to have her name on the list.
The speaker above talked about going in a store and having something trigger a coughing spell and his assuring people around him that he had CF and was not sick with something contagious. He talked about how most poeple don't appreciate the small things in life and that he had lost many people to the disease. He also talked about how the disease made him feel like less of a man and the struggles it causes in work and relationhsips.

36,"Jacob is a carrier of CF but doesn't often display symptoms (he's ""rarely sick""). He is a relatively new father and worries about his son displaying symptoms, even though his partner is not a CF carrier. Jacob also has trouble getting his loved ones to become more vocal supporters of CF research because he usually feels normal. He recently underwent testing to see about his CF, and the testing was very uncomfortable. He visited a doctor who normally sees younger patients (kids). He was electrocuted on each arm for 10 minutes - while hooked up to something that looked like a car battery- at a time and then had to sweat into gauze pads. 
Laura had a baby a few years ago that has a form of CF that could develop if exacerbated. She found out about a week or two after her baby was born that it had a type of CF. Since then she and her family have to drive 5 hours to a different area for routine testing. Laura is worried to leave her baby with friends or a daycare because her symptoms could be exacerbated. That happened recently.
Molly had an accent and is currently attempting to receive a transplant as a result of her CF. She wasn't as active in fighting her CF until a friend of hers recently died. She then underwent lots of testing in July to see if she could be a candidate for a transplant, and although she wasn't at first, she is now. She is going back to perform more tests tomorrow and hopes to get a transplant soon.
Morgan is a poet. Morgan has CF and detailed a recent experience in which he was in a store and the spray of perfume caused him to have a coughing fit. A woman next to him looked at him funny, so Morgan felt the need to tell her he wasn't contagious but rather has CF. In his head, Morgan also thought of many other things to tell the woman, but instead he smiled and walked away. The thoughts in his head included how many friends he has lost at a young age due to CF and the difficulties of his own life, including not living up to his dad's standards. He also mentioned that his lungs were sick but not ballsy enough to ""pull the trigger.""

Laura had a child that she was originally told had CF, but she lived in an area where doctors knew little about CF. They had to drive 5 hours away to a hospital with specialists to learn that her child didn't have CF but a CF related disease. This was good news, but not great news. It meant they had to drive the 5 hours for repeated testing every few months/years to ensure the child wasn't developing CF. The child did develop some symptoms which made the mother nervous
THIS VIDEO WAS hard to understand because the sound wasn't very clear. This lady had several things happen related to other friends with CF and her own personal health that took her on and off of the transplant eligibility list a few times. At the end of the video she was able to be on the transplant list.
Morgan had a coughing fit in a department store that was triggered by smelling some perfume. It made others look at him as if he was spread disease.

38,"Jacob was diagnosed with CF, but appears to have a case with minimal/nonexistent symptoms. He was diagnosed via sweat test at a childrens hospital, and he described how he was hooked up with two electrodes attached to what looked like a car battery, and asked his nurse if the test would hurt. She said no, but that it would be uncomfortable. He then described how she flipped the switch on the machine, like ""Frankenstein's monster"" (or along those lines), and he endured 10 minutes of ""electrocution"" on both of his arms. He proceeded to say how his hands were wrapping up in lots of gauze, and sent to the waiting room, where he described how awkward it was to sit in a room full of children (since he was at a children's hospital). After 30 minutes, the gauze was removed after it had collected his sweat, and he was sent home to wait. 

He said that in preparation for symptoms in the future, he maintains a health lifestyle to keep his body strong and ready to fight the disease. He has a wife named Sarah, and they have a son whom he worries for - though he knows that he does not have cystic fibrosis. He said that every time his son coughs he fears for him.
Laura's daughter Riley was diagnosed shortly after birth due to the newborn screening/tests that were performed at the hospital she was born at. Laura received a call a week after Riley was born, informing them that they had to go see their pediatrician, as Riley's tests had come back abnormal. After driving to their pediatrician, the doctor told them that Riley had cystic fibrosis, and would likely only live to 35-40 years old. Laura then took Riley to a specialist at a children's hospital 5 hours away, who informed them that she in fact did not have the ""normal"" type of cystic fibrosis, but a faulty version of a gene that could mean she would never develop symptoms, or she could develop mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. Laura mentioned that where she comes from cystic fibrosis is not very well understood, so that's why the initial doctor may have misdiagnosed her. Laura spoke about how her daughter began displaying symptoms of CF when she noticed she had fatty stools while changing her diaper. 
Molly was initially against having a lung transplant, but changed her mind after watching her friend (and fellow CF sufferer) Emma pass away the previous July. She has now undergone extensive testing, such as breathing tests, lung tests, CT scans, an ultrasound of her heart, and others all to determine if she could gain a spot on the transplant list. Her initial tests were all positive - meaning she was a good candidate for a transplant. Molly is now preparing to travel with her parents for a 10 day stretch of repeating the original tests, and at the end of those 10 days she will find out whether or not her name is being put on the list or not. 
Morgan speaks about how he was walking through a department store, smelled a perfume called ""beautiful"" that did not sit well for his respiratory tract, and began coughing. A woman nearby looked at him as if ""he was coughing up the black plague"", and he reassured her that he had a lung condition that was not contagious. He goes on to say that he thought for a moment about telling her what cystic fibrosis is: how it's not knowing how long you have left to live, watching more friends die in his 24 years of life than many people would see die in lifetimes; how he drinks and talks to his brothers ashes that he carries with him on a necklace; how he tries to play with his action figures and make their sounds louder than his mother's cries in the next room over; how it's not knowing whether or not you'll make it out of the hospital through the front door or the morgue. 

He also describes how it is also love: how it's relishing the sound of the noisy birds outside his window, because they're alive and so is he; how he relishes each day he has on this planet.

In the introduction, he begins by telling a story of how his nurse told him Not to google CF, and only look at the official website--so of course the first thing he did was google CF. Then, he freaks out, and is overwhelmed by all the bad things that could happen to him. He goes on to talk about how he didn't know that without full blown CF any of this could happen to him, then about the lack of awareness of CF. He is frustrated that he cannot connect to others with the same condition to the immune system weaknesses. He is frustrated that there is not a lot of awareness, largely because those who carry CF appear to be very healthy, but he is not always healthy. He now has a son, and although his mother does not have the mutated gene, Jacob is still constantly worried that his son may show symptoms of CF.
Laura is a mother of an infant who is a carrier for CF. She begins by talking about how the doctors had informed the parents that the tests for their newborn were unusual, and it indicated that her child, while not having CF, has the possibility of developing mild to severe symptoms. Laura is extremely distraught as a parent at the possibility that her child could only live to 30-40 years. The resources in their local pediatrician are not very good for CF, so they have to drive 5 hours to another town to treat their child, and very difficult to get an infant to cooperate in a long distance driving trip. She's worried because her child will now have to undergo constant monitoring, take tests, and be shielded from a normal upbringing in order to avoid all the potential triggers for CF.
Molly is a young woman who has CF and is in need of a lung transplant. She has recently lost her good friend Emma (and later mentions having lost her Dad), and has resolved to fight as much as she can to stay alive in response. She details much of the process it takes to be able to get a lung transplant--people think it is as easy as getting on a list, but it is a long series of tests and analysis and results. Molly tells her story of needing a lung transplant but developing a harmful bacterium that prevented her from getting one, but luckily she is now 18 months clear of it. Thus, she is able to undergo the series of tests and luckily qualified for a lung transplant.
Morgan is a young man who delivered his video in a prosaic style similar to that of slam-poetry. He begins with his own anecdote of walking in a department store, when a perfume ironically coined ""Delicious"" sets off a coughing fit. He apologizes to a disgusted shopper next to him, explaining that he has CF and that it isn't contagious, when he has a moment of realization. He wonders what it would be like to tell her what CF really is, not just that its not contagious. He then details moments of his life that are painful: being confined to the hospital beds, wondering if he would be able to grow up, feeling bitter that other kids would talk about wanting to be a fireman or policeman and wanting to just be able to have that choice, feeling bitter that people complain about Mondays at work and think he has it better because he doesn't need to work but he just wants to be able to complain about Mondays at work, feeling worthless and dependent on people around him, family strain of his parents who are pained by their child's pain, losing friends around him, finding a home in a hospital, appreciating the little things in life because he is grateful to be alive, and more. He closes by saying that in the end, he smiled at the shopper and walked away.

He also worries about his son's cough, although probably doesn't have to, as his wife isn't a carrier. because he doesn't look sick, sometimes people forget he is. 
Laura has a daughter named Riley who had an abnormal newborn screening. she lives in an area when not much is known about CF, so when it was determined that Riley had it, she was sent to a hospital five hours away. Riley didn't have CF, but had a gene that could develop into CF. The first time Laura saw fatty stool in Riley's diaper, she freaked out. She called the hospital 5 hours away and was told she could make an appointment and drive up, or reach out to her local pediatrician.
Molly decided to try to get on the transplant list because she watched her friend die at the age of 22. She had an accent and was hard to understand. 
Morgan was passionate. He has CF, and was triggered by a scent in a department store. After a look from a passer-by, he thought about spouting off a ton of information about CF, his family and friends that have passed, what it was like in a hospital room, how he made friends with the nurses, he wears his brother's ashes around his neck and more, but decided against it. He smiled and left. He did tell her it wasn't contagious and that he had CF. He was tearful.

45,"He spoke in detail a lot about the sweat test and how it made him feel, etc. I was waiting for him to say what CF was but he didn't say it, so I mostly focused on his eyes - the redness and how tearful they looked. I believe he also said he took the sweat test recently... and then mentioned towards the end about his own child and how it will be like for them. He and his partner (wife?) have both CF and so they have mutated genes, and I think that's the part where he talked about CF people only being able to be around other CF people. His eyes there reddened more and appeared more tearful. 
It was a little hard to focus on her baby (Riley?) because she went into great detail about the inconveniences --- the distance (5 hours) to the hospital, the long wait times, future testings for Riley and how she as a parent would be involved in the logistics of it (traveling, etc.). She mostly spoke from a parent's point of view which was understandable but all I kept thinking about during this video was Riley and what it was like for her because she is so young at the time of diagnosis and so symptoms may take time to appear. She also talked about fatty poop on Riley's diaper as a symptom. She said something like, ""As a parent, I am constantly looking for symptoms and keeping an eye out."" I believe the diaper part was something she kept from her husband because he happened to not be present at the time she made the discovery. 
This video was very emotional for me because obviously she is crying as she is speaking - or at least keeping herself from not sobbing too much. She started off saying how her mother had just passed away from CF. This video was hard to hear throughout due to her strong accent and the machine sounds. But I do remember her asking her viewers to pray for her (""the best birthday present"") for positive test results that might turn things around for her. I dont remember exactly what it was but she was 18 months clear for something. Maybe a growth? 
Also an emotional video for me. Started off with him telling about a time he coughed and how an old lady (passing by?) commented about it (maybe about how ""germy"" his cough was), and he told her he had CF. Then he goes on about the thoughts he had in his mind during that moment. He spoke of the daily lifestyle of a CF person as someone with CF -- talking about the struggles, suicidal thoughts but not wanting to die, the gratitude for life and little things, etc. He also spoke about his friends mostly younger than 25 all dying one by one and how, as much as he tried to motivate his other CF friends, how he knew deep down they were not going to make it. He appeared both heartbroken and hopeful in the video, much like how he described how living with CF is/can be like. He angrily spoke of someone bitching about their morning when he thought how wonderful it was to bitch about any day that you're alive. Also about appreciating the sounds of a bird because you know it has life and so do you.

CLoset CF facility is 5 hours away and it is a total drain to get there, physically and financially. So far lots of testing and surveillance for no treatment yet. Baby recently developed steorrhea and CF facility referred them to local pediatrician. She spoke about stressors like the travel, not being able to socialize with other children due to risk of infection, cost of treatments, medications. Stress over not being able to work. She spoke about when children go into the hospital with complication of CF, they are there for weeks and months. 
This girl was British I think. She recently lost someone close to CF.

Spoke about what an arduous process the transplant work up is. 
This guy developed a coughing fit after being exposed to department store perfume and then kind of gave a monologue of what CF represents in his life- the loss of brothers and sisters, the shame over having to collect disability, the uncomfortable procedures- needles, tests, blood work, hospitalizations, not being able to think about the future goals. Not being able to have a romantic relationship. His father's disappointment in him. Also tried to present the positive, basically the gift of waking up every day- kind of felt exasparated with healthy people who complain about ""Mondays"".

Felt sadness that he believes he is ill.  Hope that he will decide he wants to be healthy and think himself well.  Stop believing what doctor's tell you, think for yourself.  I began to wonder why the researchers were playing the distracting, patterned tones?  Dozed out for a few seconds because I felt tired.  
Once I realized she was a military member I was a bit more interested, however I felt more pity for her and sadness that she has a sick child and will be at the mercy of doctors for a long period.  I also got tired listening to this story as the litany of things to do to care for the sick child was long and I felt sad for the child having to endure treatments, tests, doctors, poor health and sad parents. 
I had a hard time understanding this person so I tuned out most of this video.
I liked the way he organized his thoughts and presented them in a poem.  Felt sad for him that he believes he is sick.  He must have a high pain tolerance will all those tatoo's.  He seemed very sad that he's lost so many people to this disease and I thought he may need to meet healthy people/friends.

48,"that cf people can not get together for a support group because of low immune system. the test as a adult was very unnerving and painful. always worring about his child coming down with the disease.
there is not a lot of knowledgeable people in her area. some people do not have the money or resources to take there sick child to drs or supply all needed test or medications.  lots of signs to look for in a cf child to see if they develop new symptoms.
she had to go through a lot to get a transplant.
basically there are so many triggers and many of his family and friends didnt make it. he wanted to explain this to a lady when he had a coughing fit, but he just walked away

49,"Jacob was tested for CF. He was hooked up to ""what looked like a car battery"" and ""electrocuted"" on each arm for 10 minutes. After that, he had to sit in a waiting room for 30 minutes with his arms wrapped in gauze. The strangest part of that for him was he was the only adult. After 30 minutes, the gauze was removed and sent off for to be analyzed.  
Laura got a call from her daughter Riley's PED that there was an abnormal result on the daughter's newborn assessment and they would have to come in. They were on their way to Ft Benning, and turned around. At the PEDs office, they were told Riley had CF. They live in rural Georgia and have to travel to Augusta, about 5 hours away, for treatments. Laura discovered a fatty stool, which is a CF symptom, that her husband had missed. She called the hospital in Augusta, they told her that she could make and appointment but would probably be better off calling her local PED
Molly's friend Emma died from CF complications in her early 20's. This was a shock and a wake-up call to Molly. She told her doctor that she wanted to be put on the transplant list for a new lung. She was not eligible at first because she had a bacteria that made her ineligible. At the time of the video, she had been free of the bacteria for 18 months, which made her a candidate for the list. She has to undergo four days of testing to determine that she was both healthy enough and sickly enough to be put on the list. All she wants for Christmas is to find out that she is on the list.
A perfume, called delicious, in a department store, set off a CF coughing attack. A lady in the store looked at him like he had unleashed the plague. She told him he's not contagious, he has a lung condition. He thought about telling her what CF really means, about how many friends he's lost, how his mother weeps not knowing if she will survive him, how he feels like he's a disappointment to his father because he will never be a strong man.

51,"Jacob talked about how he doesn't have any of the typical symptoms of CF, and so many people, even family members, don't consider him to be sick, even though he is. He said that it's really hard to always be worried about something bad (related to CF) happening to him.
Laura talked about her daughter, who had a cystic fibrosis metabolic problem. A week after her birth, the doctor said that something was abnormal in her daughter's newborn exams. The local doctors don't know much about CF, so they told Laura that her daughter had CF. In reality, she only had 1 copy of the defective CF gene. For the first 1.5 years of her daughters life, they had to drive to a different doctor 5 hours away for check-ups. They constantly monitor her to see if any symptoms are developing. Recently there was a possible CF symptom, and they are waiting to see the results.
Molly mentioned that a friend had passed away from CF, and this motivated her to try to get a lung transplant, even though she hadn't wanted one before. Transplants are a lot more complex than most people think, and she had to get a lot of different examinations to make sure that she is a good transplant candidate. These exams include lots of blood tests, an ultrasound of her heart, psychology tests, etc. She had all the tests done 6 months ago and soon she will be going to get them again. If all goes well, she will be added to the transplant list.
Morgan said he was at the mall looking at perfume when he started coughing, and a woman nearby looked at him with disgust. He thought about what he should tell her. Should he tell her about cystic fibrosis? There are a lot of terrible things that CF brings, such as fear of dying. More people he knows have passed away in his 24 years than some people have pass away in 60. He wears the ashes of his brother around his neck. There aren't support groups because people with CF have weak immune systems. But there are some positives. He wakes up everyday grateful to be alive. He listens to the birds and is happy that he's alive with them. In the end, Morgan decides just to smile and laugh at the woman.

52,"Jacob had a tough experience at the clinic similar to being electrocuted. Most of his family does not have CF and he looks normal so it is hard for him to talk about the disease and spread awareness.
Her child has CF and it is hard for her to take her child to the hospital and all the related troubles she had to endure for her child.  
Her sister had CF and her liver was affected but she could not find a donor and she died at the age of 20. It had a deep impact on Molly who also suffers from the same condition and is waiting for a liver transplant. She also has a bug which prevented her from being in the transplant list due to the risk but the medicines have controlled the bug so he can be hopeful of a transplant again.
Morgan tells us his experience with the disease and how he has seen so many of his close friends and family fall to CF but is helpless and can only fight this condition. He tells the experience of interaction where due to his condition he coughed in the store which alarmed someone but he could not tell his pains as all he could do is smile and move on.

54,"Jacob talked about how he learned that he was a carrier of the CF gene.  He was told not to look this up on the internet, but he did, which freaked him out.  He had a really hard time emotionally, not knowing if he would start to express symptoms of CF, especially because he wanted to appear strong and so he didn't talk about it with his family.  He also described the sweat test itself, which was used to test him for CF.  He had to go to a children's hospital, had his arm hooked up to what he described as something that looked like ""a car battery"" and then had to be electrocuted on each arm for ten minutes each.  He said that it was very unpleasant.  He then had his arms wrapped in lots of gauze, sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes, then the doctor took a piece of gauze and send it to the lab to be tested with his sweat.  After he was diagnosed, Jacob wanted to meet with other CFers, but he couldn't because they could easily give bacterial diseases to each other.  CF is therefore a very isolating disease.  It's also hard because he doesn't look sick, and he doesn't talk about it much with his family, so his family often forgets that he's sick.
Laura talked about how, when her daughter was first born, the doctor screened her and got back bad results.  He called Laura and her husband to the hospital, where he told her that the infant had CF.  However, this wasn't totally true.  Laura had only one copy of the gene, but the doctor didn't realize what this meant, because they lived in an area where CF wasn't very well understood.  Laura and her husband took their child to another doctor five hours away, who told them that, with this one copy, she could develop no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms, depending on what triggers she was exposed to.  To keep an eye on the child's symptoms, Laura had to drive her daughter five hours every two months to get tests done to see if she had developed symptoms of CF.  Because you never know what triggers could be present in an environment, Laura can't trust her daughter with other family members.  All the driving and whatnot is very tiring, and insurance often doesn't cover all the medications and treatments needed to treat CF, so it can be very financially taxing.
Molly talked about how someone she knew (I couldn't hear this video very well) who also had CF died before her name ever got on the transplant list for lungs.  Molly had never considered a lung transplant before, but after this person died, she decided she had to do as much as she could to fight CF.  At first, she wasn't qualified to be put on the list because she had a bacterial infection, but after 18 months of being infection-free, her doctor said she qualified.  She then had a bunch of tests and blood drawn.  When the tests came back saying she could get a lung transplant, she had the tests redone at the hospital where the transplant would occur.  She met the transplant team, a psychologist, and a social worker to make sure she was a good place mentally and had the necessary support network to recover from the transplant.
Morgan talked about how, one day he was at a perfume store, and the perfume triggered a coughing attack.  A lady looked like she thought he was going to get her sick, so he explained that he had CF so it wasn't contagious.  She started to look up what CF was, and he briefly considered explaining to her what it was.  He says in the video that CF is being stuck in the hospital on your birthday, your friends visiting you so you're not all alone.  That CF is watching your friends lay in a hospital bed, telling them they're gonna get through this but knowing they won't.  CF is losing more loved ones than most people will lose in four life times.  That CF is get angry at people saying they're jealous you don't have to work, when you wish you were healthy enough to go to work to bitch about Mondays.  That CF is listening to kids talking about growing up and being a fireman or a policeman, and wondering if you'll ever get to grow up at all.  That CF is depression.  But CF also has some good things.  It's about love.  It's about finding that special someone who will stay by your side, even though they know they will have to watch you die.  It's about knowing that your homophobic parents are stupid, because when you're lying in a hospital bed, race and sexual orientation don't matter.  In the end, he decided not to say anything to the lady and just walked away.

55,"Jacob talked about being hooked up to a machine that looked like a car battery with jumper cables coming out of it at a children's hospital, and being (seemingly) electrocuted for 10 minutes. The nurse told him it would not hurt but it would not be pleasant. He had a TV in the corner of the room to distract him. He then went to the waiting room with a bunch of children, with his wrist wrapped in heavy gauze. After 30 minutes,, the sweat under the gauze was placed in a capsule and sent for testing. I remember Jacob saying that he carries the gene for cystic fibrosis, although he does not have the illness. He went to Dallas at one point for evaluation/treatment. He said while he nor his wife have the disease, he becomes very worried every time their child coughs, even though their child likely does not have the disease.
I remember Laura getting a phone call a week after her child was born telling her to come in the next morning to talk to the doctor, and saying that a doctor told her that the child had cystic fibrosis and would only live to 35-40 years old. Another doctor said that the child did not have full-blown cystic fibrosis, but a related, but less harmful disease. I believe Laura's child had fatty stool, which is a sign of cystic fibrosis. She called a doctor 5 hours away, but that doctor adviser her to take her child to their local pediatrician.
I believe Molly had a British accent. She said her best friend Emma died of cystic fibrosis before the age of 20. This is why Molly wanted to be added to the transplant list as soon as possible. She said she would be receiving a transplant, and it felt like Christmas to be added to the transplant list.
Morgan talked about all of the things a person with cystic fibrosis could not do because of the disease. He talked about being unable to hold a job because of mornings where you can't get out of bed due to the illness, and the challenges of receiving welfare/benefits. He talked about wearing the ashes of his brother around his neck who died due to the disease. He talked about staring at the bottom of an empty Jack Daniels bottle and the suicidal thoughts that come from having lost people close to him due to the disease. He talked about growing up in a prejudiced, homophobic family, but your race and what gender you love does not matter to the people fighting the disease. These people as well as the nurses and other hospital staff who help you when you're in the hospital become your family. He talked about friends staying at the hospital until midnight on your birthday so you don't have to be there alone. He talked about ""bitching about Mondays"", but at least those who do are alive to ""bitch about Mondays"".

56,"Jacob has CF. His doctor explicitly told him not to Google search CF, but only to search a treatment website for CF patients. Jacob searched what the doctor had told him not to and he became anxious and worried. Later in the video he began to talk about how his family and friends do not see him as a CF patient.
I do not remember much about what Laura said but she was very sad and emotional in talking about one of her relatives and the effect that CF has had on her and her family. 
Molly also, was very emotional in discussing her journey with CF. Do not remember specific points she made.
Of all the videos, Morgan was the most emotional. His battle with the devastation of CF persists across many generations. The way he presented his story was almost in a very suicidal mood and tone. He talked about how people essentially take a living day for granted by complaining about the day, when individuals with CF and the families of those patients have an even bigger struggle.

57,"Jacob talked about his experience going to a children hospital and getting a diagnosis for CF . It was painful to him as they applied an electric current through his skin, and performed the sweat test for it. He also talks about how painful it is to live as a CF patient, both emotionally and physically. Emotionally because he cannot and is not allowed to come in contact with other CF patients, and has to live a lonely life of his own. 
Laura talked about her experience growing up as a mother of a child who had CF. She talked about the financial, emotional and physical stress it put on her body and how it affected her. She also talked about the five hour drive that she had to do every two months with her infant, which she claimed was not fun, and how she had to worry about her child every time as she must make sure that the child is not exposed to trigger factors. 
Molly talked about her experience living as a CF patient and how hard it was for her. She talked about lung transplant and how she was getting ready for it. She also talked about how hard it is to do a lung transplant . Had a British accent, couldn't really understand, for the most part, what she was trying to say. 
Morgan gave a slam poetry like talk about living a life as a CF patient . He talked about how he had to painfully watch his siblings die before they were 25, and how he too knows that he will not live long. He said that he carries a necklace of ash to remember all those he has lost. He talked about his painful life. He talked about the societal pressure he receives and how he is frustrated with it. He then went on to say how he feels so alive, although he knows that he will not live for a long period. He then recalled giving a nice smile to an old lady who looked at him like he had the black plague when he coughed, and he told her that he had CF, recalled his life living with CF, and how the lady will never get to know his experiences. He then gave a smile to her and walked away.

Laura must drive five hours to get her child to the doctor. It was scary for her to change her baby's diaper and see a symptom of CF.
Molly is looking for a lung transplant. I think her best friend died from CF.
He is the poem dude. His brother died. He's upset when people complain about Mondays. His dad is (for lack of a better word) disappointed that he won't have a normal life. He's glad to hear the birds in the morning. He appreciates people being there for him through all the treatment.
